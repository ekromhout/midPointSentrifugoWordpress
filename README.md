# This project adds Sentrifugo as an
# open source HR system to the midPoint
# complex demo. Documentation of that demo
# is available at:
# https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/display/MID/Complex+midPoint+integration+demo

# After building with docker-compose up
# and running the ./upload_objects script
# Sentrifugo should be available at localhost:8080
# You can login with banderson/password or
# empp0001/59887e9a7cb85 to be a super
# user in Sentrifugo
# and midPoint with the AMQP connector to
# process messages from Sentrifugo should
# be available on https://locahost:8443

# This also now adds a Wordpress instance
# and a Wordpress connector to midPoint
# You can login to Wordpress at
# http://localhost with the account
# and the password 54y6RxN7GfC7aes3

# I have not configured Shibboleth logins
# for Sentrifugo or Wordpress at this time.
